    <h3>
        Problem
    </h3>
    <p>
        The system is built on Moodle, a monolithic legacy application <span class="fragment">(read: ugly system)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        UI is looking old and tired.  Stakeholders are demanding a more modern and mobile UI, but this is not a priority for upstream maintainers.  
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        The underlying theme system is incredibly complex.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Changes to the UI are done by committee. <span class="fragment">Known to be a drawn out and traumatic process for participants.</span>
    </p>

    <h3>
        Solution
    </h3>
    <p>
        Start small...
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Convince your boss that changes can be done with minimal committee interaction. 
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Convince committee that you'll be providing a thoughtful and sane approach.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Start with the system icons.

        Bonus: Earned credibility with the committee

    <h3>Proposal</h3>
    <p class="fragment">
        Make UI consistent.  Make all UI elements share similar theme.  Use consistent color scheme.  Use consistent fonts.  Usability and accesibility focus.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Integrate modern CSS framework (like Boostrap) 
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Make it mobile friendly.  Needs to be good looking and functional.
    </p>

    <h3>Overpromise...</h3>
    <p>Rewriting the theme system is not an option.  It's difficult and time consuming, and would need to convince Moodle community.</p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Need alternate approach...

    <h3>SASS + Compass</h3>
    <p>
        Build a custom CSS toolchain using SASS + Compass (Ruby gems)
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        CSS build system is incredibily flexible and allows importing any external CSS framework as well as overriding current styles. 
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Possible to inject Boostrap framework styles into existing theme classes using SASS `@extend` construct.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        No need to touch underlying Moodle theme system.  My system sits on top and uses the CSS cascade to override the theme.

    <h3>Resposive</h3>
    <p>
        Achieved responsive design on a legacy system through clever user of breakpoints.
    </p>
    <p>
        Legacy applicaction becomes mobile friendly overnight.

    <h3>Overdeliver</h3>
    <p>
        Build system works better than expected.  Allows us to upgrade from Boostrap 2 to Bootstrap 3 in a single sprint
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Campus reports general rise in happiness
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Presented my methods at Moodle conference and Moodle community takes note, but they've already invested in rewriting their theme to use Boostrap styles.  Having intially targetted Boostrap 2, upgrading from Boostrap 2 to Boostrap 3 takes them 6 months!
